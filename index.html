										<h2 class="major">Programming Experince</h2>
										<p>My programming experince started from 2020 when I began my degree and finished my journey in 2022. During this tuime 
											I have learnt languages such as C, C#, C++, Java, Python, .NET Framework, HTML5 & CSS, JSON & XML, HASKELL. I have learnt and 
											used tools such as Docker to help run a python server for Advanced web University Assignement.  
											&nbsp; <br><br>

											I have also have spent a lot of time working with Unity and creating 2D and 3D based games. 
											My journey began making a snake game with the IDE Eclipse for Java. This was
											part of my Minor. Then after this I went on to making a Space Invaders type game in the same langauge with a colleague.
											
											Then Finally in my second part of my Minor we got the chance to work with the Unity Engine. First game I created in that 
											was a game called "Having a Kick About". This was simple 3D game that involved two players trying to score a goal on a football pitch.

										<h2 class="major">Achievements & Internships</h2>
										<p>Completed Bachelor of Information Sciences Majoring in Software
											Engineering & Minor in Games Programming at Massey University. 

											My Graduation cermony was in May 2023.
											<br><br>							
											I have worked at Integrated Control Solutions in Albany Rosedale at end of 2021. I worked in the research & development department. 
											I was challenged to work on existing problems that either had bugs that had to be resolved or create new innovative solutions to fix an existing problem that was occurring. 
											This could be through the front-end or back-end.
											<br><br>
											- &nbsp; I worked on website development with SQL, HTML, CSS and Angular.
											<br><br>
											- &nbsp;Azure DevOps and cloud integration control.
											<br><br>
											-&nbsp;New code documentation for other developers.
											<br><br>
											- &nbsp; I was required to work on unit testing with other colleagues to make sure that the 
											backend code in C# had a 95% pass rate in code coverage.
											
											Internships: 
											<br><br>
											Along with my internship experiences through my degree. 
											I got the opportunity to work on an existing Android app that was used to scan logs at a tree company called Timber Smart.
											 This was a university summer project.  
											 I got the chance with my colleagues to experience modifying existing code and meeting requirements that we were told by the company head. 
											 This was a unique experience held through Massey University.
