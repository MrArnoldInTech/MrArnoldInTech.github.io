										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p> Hello there! Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Arnold Fruish, a dedicated Software Engineer graduate from Massey University.
											</p>

											<p>
											I am eager to expand my skill set and embark on a fulfilling journey in the tech world, my goal is to evolve into a versatile Fullstack Developer. 
											Open to diverse IT roles, I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest technologies. 
											Explore my portfolio to discover my passion for innovation and dedication to excellence in the realm of software development.

										<h2 class="major">Programming Experience</h2>
										<p>My programming experience started from 2020 when I began my degree and finished my journey in 2022. During this time 
											I have learnt languages such as:

											 C, C#, C++, Java, Python, .NET Framework, HTML5 & CSS, JSON & XML, HASKELL, Prolog, PHP & SQL and Angular. 
											<br><br>
											I have learnt and used tools such as Docker to help run a Python server for Advanced Web University assignment. I have also used 
											tools such as MySQL and PHPMyAdmin for Databases.
											&nbsp; <br><br>

											I have also spent a lot of time working with Unity and creating 2D and 3D-based games. 
											My journey began making a snake game with the IDE Eclipse for Java. This was
											part of my Minor. Then after this, I went on to make a Space Invaders type game in the same language with a colleague.
											
											Then finally in the second part of my Minor, we got the chance to work with the Unity Engine. First game I created in that 
											was a game called "Having a Kick About". This was a simple 3D game that involved two players trying to score a goal on a football pitch. 
											<br><br>
											(I will hopefully be uploading this soon to Github) :)

										<h2 class="major">Achievements & Internships</h2>
										<p>Completed Bachelor of Information Sciences Majoring in Software
											Engineering & Minor in Games Programming at Massey University. 

											My graduation ceremony was in May 2023.
											<br><br>							
											I worked at an Alarm Specialist company for an internship at the end of 2021. I worked in the Research & Development Department.

											I was challenged to work on existing problems that either had bugs that had to be resolved, or create new innovative solutions to fix an existing problem that was occurring. 
											This could be through the front-end or back-end.
											<br><br>
											- &nbsp; I worked on website development with SQL, HTML, CSS and Angular.
											<br><br>
											- &nbsp;Azure DevOps and Cloud Integration Control.
											<br><br>
											-&nbsp;New code documentation for other developers.
											<br><br>
											- &nbsp; I was required to work on unit testing with other colleagues to make sure that the 
											backend code in C# had a 99% pass rate in code coverage.												
											<br><br>
											Along with my internship experiences through my degree, 
											I got the opportunity to work on an existing Android app that was used to scan logs at a tree management company.
											 This was a University summer project.  
											 I got the chance with my colleagues to experience modifying existing code and meeting requirements that we were told by the company head. 
											 This was a unique experience held through Massey University.

									<div class="content">
										<h2 class="major">Spare Time & Passions</h2>
										<p>In my spare time, I love to go for motorbike rides and car drives. I am eager to learn, so that's why I made the big step and got my motorbike license. 
											I am so happy I accomplished this, as it gives me a whole unique perspective of driving on the road compared to drivers who don't know what its like riding a motorbike.
											<br><br>
											As well, in my free time I love to build computers from scratch. I thoroughly enjoy doing DIY jobs around the house. I am also passionate 
											about learning new programming languages and working on my side game project with my friend in Unity. 	
											<br><br>
											I love to play Chess to help me think and relax. Chess.com and Lichess.org are the way to play. For future plans, I 
											want to make a Chess game in one of the desired programming languages to further understand this amazing game.

											<h3 class="major">Reading From Jsonplaceholder</h3>
											<p>Very simple project this one. It was a small assignment task for one of my job 
												interviews. Simply had to use Java and make a GET request where we can read the data 
												into the application.
